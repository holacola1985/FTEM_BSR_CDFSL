1.The Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) challenge benchmark includes data from the CropDiseases [1], EuroSAT [2], ISIC2018 [3-4], and ChestX [5] datasets, which covers plant disease images, satellite images, dermoscopic images of skin lesions, and X-ray images, respectively. The selected datasets reflect real-world use cases for few-shot learning since collecting enough examples from above domains is often difficult, expensive, or in some cases not possible. In addition, they demonstrate the following spectrum of readily quantifiable domain shifts from ImageNet: 1) CropDiseases images are most similar as they include perspective color images of natural elements, but are more specialized than anything available in ImageNet, 2) EuroSAT images are less similar as they have lost perspective distortion, but are still color images of natural scenes, 3) ISIC2018 images are even less similar as they have lost perspective distortion and no longer represent natural scenes, and 4) ChestX images are the most dissimilar as they have lost perspective distortion, all color, and do not represent natural scenes.
